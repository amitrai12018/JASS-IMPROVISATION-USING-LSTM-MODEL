JASS IMPROVISATION USING LSTM

THIS PROJECT IS BASICALLY A PART OF DEEP LEARNING COURSE 5 OF DEEPLEARNING.AI. IN THIS PROBLEM I BASICALLY LEARNT HOW TO :
1)Apply an LSTM to music generation.
2)Generate your own jazz music with deep learning.

1 - Problem statement IN THIS PROJECT WAS :
You would like to create a jazz music piece specially for a friend's birthday. However, you don't know any instruments or music composition.

DATA SET OUR DATA IS IN 'data' file.

   data : Our music generation system will use 78 unique values.musical data to render it in terms of musical "values." You can informally think of each "value" as a note, which comprises a pitch and a duration. For example, if you press down a specific piano key for 0.5 seconds, then you have just played a note. In music theory, a "value" is actually more complicated than this--specifically, it also captures the information needed to play multiple notes at the same time. For example, when playing a music piece, you might press down two piano keys at the same time (playing multiple notes at the same time generates what's called a "chord"). But we don't need to worry about the details of music theory for this assignment. For the purpose of this assignment, all you need to know is that we will obtain a dataset of values, and will learn an RNN model to generate sequences of values.
